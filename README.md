This is a Machine Learning Project. It involves predicting the revenue of an unreleased movie based on movie parameters like movie cast and crew, whether the movie belongs to a franchise, etc. 
Steps involved are:
1. Data Preprocessing
Preprocess python notebook contains all preprocessing steps based on data analysis of the file train.csv
2. Applying ML algorithm on the processed data
Final csv files, train_final.csv and test_final.csv, are created after preprocessing the initial dataset. On this dataset, KNN algorithm is applied to predict the revenue of the movie. This is the KNN_Predictions.csv file, which is the final resultant file.
